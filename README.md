## Use Case

We all get those moments during work or browsing when motivation dips — and a little boost can totally change the vibe. This popup shows you fresh, inspiring quotes right when you open a tab or visit a page, giving your brain that quick spark to keep pushing. It’s like a tiny cheerleader in your browser, reminding you to keep grinding and stay focused — but without interrupting your flow or annoying you, because it only pops up once per site visit.

## Why I Made This

I wanted something simple but effective to help myself stay motivated throughout the day without disrupting my workflow. Instead of scrolling through endless apps or sites, I thought—why not bring motivation *to* me, quietly and beautifully? Building this also helped me sharpen my JavaScript skills and learn how to work efficiently with code prompts and quick iterations.
